# witr-rs

English | [简体中文](README.md)

**Why is this running?** — given a process name, PID, port or file, trace back who started it and how.

A Rust implementation of [pranshuparmar/witr](https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr) (Go, Apache-2.0), aligned with its platform data-collection strategy.

**Run `witr-rs` with no arguments to enter the interactive TUI**, laid out like the original: four tabs at the top (1. Processes / 2. Ports / 3. Containers / 4. Locks), the process table on the left (PID / User / Name / CPU% / Mem / Started), a live trace summary of the selected process on the right, and key hints at the bottom — auto-refreshing every 3 seconds. Press `Enter` for the full-screen **process detail page** (70% details on the left + 30% environment variables on the right, each pane scrolls independently). When stdout is piped it degrades to a static process table (`--list` forces that).

## TUI keys

Vim-style browsing (aligned with the Go witr):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` `k` / `↑` `↓` | Move selection |
| `g` `G` | Jump to first / last row |
| `f` `b` `space` / PgUp PgDn | Page down / up |
| `h` `l` / `←` `→` | Switch tabs |
| `1`–`4` / Tab | Jump to tab / cycle focus (table ↔ details) |
| `/` | Search: Processes tab matches PID/user/name; Ports tab matches port/PID/process/address/proto/state (filters are per-tab; Enter applies, Esc clears) |
| `Enter` | Processes tab: full-screen process detail (details + environment variables); Ports tab: port detail (all connections on that port + owning process) |
| `p` `n` `u` `c` `m` `t` | Sort by PID / name / user / CPU / memory / start time; press again to flip direction |
| `x` | Kill the selected process (y/n confirm) |
| `r` | Refresh now |
| In detail pages | `j/k` scroll, `d/u` half page, `g/G` top/bottom, `b/f` page, `Tab` switch panes, `c` copy pane text, `Esc/q` back |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |

Details of the selected process refresh 500ms after the cursor stops moving (debounced, so holding `j` doesn't fire a query per row) — same as the original's `selectionDebounce`.

**Port detail page**: select a port on the Ports tab and press `Enter` to see every socket on that port — the LISTEN entry plus **the requests happening right now** (each ESTABLISHED connection with its peer address, state and owning PID/process; a snapshot taken when the page opens). The Owner panel below shows the full trace of the listening process (attribution + ancestry + warnings). `Tab` switches focus between Connections and Owner, `j/k/d/u/g/G/b-f` scrolls, `Esc` returns.

**Process detail page**: left trace panel (identity, Started-by attribution, Ancestry Tree, Open Files, risk score, warnings), right environment variables pane; `c` copies the focused pane as plain text to the clipboard.

**Risk score**: each process aggregates 0–10 points of risk signals — binary running from a temp directory, deleted binary still running, `curl | sh`-style downloads piped into shells, LD_PRELOAD/DYLD injection, ESTABLISHED connections to public addresses. The CLI prints `risk N/10: signal list`; the TUI detail pages show the same.

**Crash-loop detection** (TUI): the same process identity reappearing under a new pid counts as one restart; the `Rst` column shows the total, and ≥2 restarts within 5 minutes raise a yellow warning in the detail panes — crash loops are visible at a glance.

**Instantaneous CPU + Trend sparkline** (TUI): computed from the delta of cumulative CPU time between refreshes (not the lifetime average); the Trend column draws the last 8 samples as an 8-level sparkline, and the `c` sort key sorts on it.

**`--export`**: `witr-rs --pid <N> --export` prints a paste-ready plain-text diagnostic report (including environment variable values and the open-files list).

**Containers tab**: enumerates containers via runtime CLIs on PATH (docker / podman / nerdctl), showing Runtime / ID / State / Status / Image / Name; `/` filters by name/image/ID/runtime/state. Enumeration runs on a background thread (a hung runtime CLI never freezes the UI) and auto-refreshes every 3s; refreshes keep the stale table visible so nothing flashes — the loading placeholder only shows on first load. **`Enter` opens the container detail page**: container attributes on the left (Name/Runtime/ID/Image/State/Status/Ports), in-container process list on the right (matched via cgroups on Linux; on macOS/Windows container processes live in a VM and a note is shown).

## Platform support

| Capability | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Process table | direct `/proc` reads | `ps` | ToolHelp32 snapshot |
| cmdline / cwd / exe | `/proc/<pid>/*` | `ps` + `lsof` | PowerShell (Get-CimInstance) |
| Port → process | `/proc/net/*` + fd inode matching | `lsof -i` | `netstat -ano` |
| File → process | `/proc/*/fd` | `lsof` | ✗ (needs Sysinternals handle.exe) |
| Service attribution | systemd (`systemctl status`) | launchd (`launchctl list` + plist probing) | SCM (`tasklist /svc`, recognizes services.exe descendants) |
| Container attribution | cgroups (docker/containerd/podman/lxc) | ✗ | ✗ |
| Environment variables (`--env` / TUI detail page) | ✓ `/proc/<pid>/environ` (same user) | ✓ same-user processes via `ps -E` (the rest are SIP-limited; the pane says so) | ✗ |
| Start time | btime + starttime | `ps etime` | CIM CreationDate |

External commands required: Linux — none strictly (systemctl/docker optional); macOS — `ps`/`lsof` (built in); Windows — `powershell`/`netstat`/`tasklist` (built in).

## Install

Grab the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yaowenqiang/witr-rs/releases) (sha256 checksum files included). Pushing a `v*` tag makes CI build every target automatically:

| File | Platform |
|---|---|
| `witr-rs-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` | Linux x86_64 (static) |
| `witr-rs-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` | Linux ARM64 (static) |
| `witr-rs-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | macOS Intel |
| `witr-rs-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | macOS Apple Silicon |
| `witr-rs-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` | Windows x86_64 |

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo build --release          # host platform
cargo check --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu   # all three platforms type-check everywhere
cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo test
```

## Usage

```bash
witr-rs                       # no args: interactive TUI on a terminal; static table when piped
witr-rs --tree                # no args + --tree: full system process tree (--list forces static too)
witr-rs --json                # no args + --json: every process as JSON
witr-rs nginx                 # by process name (substring match)
witr-rs python --exact        # exact match (case-insensitive)
witr-rs --pid 1234            # by PID
witr-rs --port 8080           # who owns this port
witr-rs --file /var/log/x.log # who holds this file open
witr-rs nginx --tree          # ancestry tree + children
witr-rs nginx --short         # one-line output (script-friendly)
witr-rs --port 8080 --json    # machine-readable JSON
witr-rs nginx --env           # also collect environment variables (full on Linux; same-user on macOS)
witr-rs nginx --pid 1         # mix multiple targets
witr-rs --pid 1234 --export   # paste-ready plain-text diagnostic report
```

### Exit codes

Attribution priority: container > service manager (systemd/launchd/SCM) > cron/tmux/screen/ssh > interactive shell. When the Linux `service_source` falls back to "init" the pipeline drops it and tries the generic detectors instead.

## Known limitations (v0.2)

- Locks tab is Linux-only; TUI Ports/Containers/detail pages are snapshots from when they opened — `r` refreshes manually
- Windows process details rely on batched PowerShell queries (one call per target, 20s timeout guard)
- The CPU% column is empty for Windows in the TUI (tasklist doesn't provide it)
- Container attribution is Linux-only (container processes behind colima/Docker Desktop on macOS are not attributed)
- `--file` on Windows reports "unsupported" as a warning
- macOS `launchctl list` only covers the current user domain; system daemons need sudo to be labeled
